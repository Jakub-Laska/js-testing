// In JavaScript, you can choose single quotes ('),
// double quotes ("), or backticks (`) to wrap your strings in.
// All of the following will work:
const single = 'Single quotes';
const double = "Double quotes";
const backtick = `Backtick`;

console.log(single);
console.log(double);
console.log(backtick);  
// Strings declared using single quotes and strings declared using double quotes are the same


// Strings declared using backticks are a special kind of string called a template literal
// Inside a template literal, you can wrap JavaScript variables or expressions inside ${ },
// and the result will be included in the string:
const name = "Chris";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}`;
console.log(greeting); // "Hello, Chris"

// // You can use the same technique to join together two variables:
const one = "Hello, ";
const two = "how are you?";
const joined = `${one}${two}`;
console.log(joined); // "Hello, how are you?"

// // You can use ${} only with template literals, not normal strings. 
// // You can concatenate normal strings using the + operator:
const greeting = "Hello";
const name = "Chris";
console.log(greeting + ", " + name); // "Hello, Chris"

// // However, template literals usually give you more readable code:
const greeting = "Hello";
const name = "Chris";
console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}`); // "Hello, Chris"

  (score / highestScore) * 100
}%.`;
console.log(output); // "I like the song Fight the Youth. I gave it a score of 90%."

// Template literals respect the line breaks in the source code, so you can write strings that span multiple lines like this:
const newline = `One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,`;
console.log(newline);
/*
One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
*/

// To have the equivalent output using a normal string you'd have to include line break characters (\n) in the string:
const newline = "One day you finally knew\nwhat you had to do, and began,";
console.log(newline);

/*
One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
*/

// Including quotes in strings
// One common option is to use one of the other characters to declare the string:
const goodQuotes1 = 'She said "I think so!"';
const goodQuotes2 = `She said "I'm not going in there!"`;



// Another option is to escape the problem quotation mark. 
// Escaping characters means that we do something to them to
// make sure they are recognized as text, not part of the code.
// In JavaScript, we do this by putting a backslash just before the character.
// Try this:
const bigmouth = 'I\'ve got no right to take my placeâ€¦';
console.log(bigmouth);


// If you have a numeric variable that you want to convert to a string or a string variable that you want to convert to a number, you can use the following two constructs:
const myString = "123";
const myNum = Number(myString);
console.log(typeof myNum);
// number

const myNum2 = 123;
const myString2 = String(myNum2);
console.log(typeof myString2);
// string
